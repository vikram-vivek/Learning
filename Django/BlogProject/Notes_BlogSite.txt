register the models in admin.py

Invalid block tag on line 14: 'form.as_p', expected 'endblock'. Did you forget to register or load this tag?
=> Wrong call of form. correct way  {{ form.as_p }}

typos are very much the problem.
Post vs post
Comment vs comment

When CSS is not rendering check the div class

How to debug?
Check in following order.
HTML/Templates -> URLs (Pattern) -> Views ->  Model
