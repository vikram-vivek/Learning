#A building has 100 floors. One of the floors is the highest floor an egg can be dropped from without breaking.
#Assumptions in the Egg Dropping Puzzle:
#The two eggs are identical.
#If an egg does not break by dropping from a certain floor, it will not break dropping from any floor below that.
#If an egg breaks by dropping on a certain floor, it will break dropping from any floor above that.
#An egg may break by dropping on the 1st floor.
#An egg may not break by dropping even on the 100th floor.
